# Grade-Management-System
A python project made for my University Course. It is just a simple Grade Management System with the basic CRUD operations and some filtering options. In this project I practiced Test Driven Development, Layered Arhitecture, GRASP principles, Working with Python Packages, Saving and Getting data from files and Object Oriented Programming.
