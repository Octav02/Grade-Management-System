# Grade-Management-System
The Grade Management System is a Python project I developed for my university course. It allows users to manage student grades, with basic CRUD operations and filtering options. The project uses OOP principles, TDD, layered architecture, and GRASP principles. Data is stored in files and the code is modular and reusable.
